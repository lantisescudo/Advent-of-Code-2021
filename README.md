# Advent of Code 2021
 
This is the repository for my solutions to the puzzles of Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/)

Day 1 I did using the LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet because something went wrong with the Python code that was my first attempt, and I didn't bother to try fixing it.

The rest, at least through Day 6 (so far) have been done in Python.
