# Advent of Code 2021
 
This is the repository for my solutions to the puzzles of Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/)

### Notes by Day

##### Day 1
I initially did Day 1 using the LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet because something went wrong with the Python code that was my first attempt. I've since fixed it (protip: [] for ordered lists, not {}).

##### Day 4
Was out of the house most of the day, so had to do Day 4 on Day 5

##### Day 11
Was away on vacation Day 11, so did it the evening of Day 12

##### Day 12
Was away on vacation most of the day, so did Part 1 that evening. Part 2 was initially done as a (very slow) breadth-first search, so I left it to run overnight and submitted the answer in the morning of Day 13. I redid it with a depth-first search later on Day 13.
